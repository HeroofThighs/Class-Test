  <h1>Building a class website is hard</h1>
  <p>Seriously, I just started learning more advanced html then just the little bits
    i've known how to do while on DeviantArt.
    I've been typing and retyping lots of code and having to upload it and check
  the validator to make sure everything is working, but for now, I'm able to use this
as a template for my final project, hopefully I can get it done on time and not be bogged down by my English
and Digital design classes.</p>

<h1>The class</h1>
<p>There is about 15-20 people, and I have no clue what their skill levels are in this but
over half the class is better than me at this kind of stuff.</p>

<h2>What we are doing</h2>
<p>Our class is working to make a finished webpage, it's not a group effort though,
  everyone is making one for themselves.</p>

<h2>What we hope to accomplish</h2>
<p>By the end of the semester, a finished, working, webpage. Hopefully I get a good grade
on this Template, because I don't know what to write excactly for a full class
webpage just yet.</p>
